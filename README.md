# Predicting Structural Heart Disease from ECG Data Using Machine Learning and Explainable Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
Structural Heart Disease (SHD) includes conditions such as valve disorders, reduced ventricular function, and wall thickening.  
Echocardiography is the gold standard for diagnosis but is costly, requires expertise, and has limited availability.  

This project leverages **electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived features** with **machine learning** to predict **echocardiogram-confirmed SHD** and introduces an **explainable recommendation system** to support clinical decision-making.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🧠 **Predictive Modeling:** Build and fine-tune ML models for binary classification of SHD.  
- ⚖️ **Model Benchmarking:** Compare different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).  
- 🔎 **Explainability:** Apply SHAP/LIME to identify ECG features driving predictions.  
- 💬 **Recommendation System:** Use LLMs to explain model outputs in natural language and suggest clinical next steps.  

## 📂 Dataset

**Features include:**
- **Demographics:** Age, sex, acquisition year  
- **ECG Features:** Ventricular rate, atrial rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QTc interval  
- **Echocardiography Flags (binary):**  
  - Reduced LVEF (≤ 45%)  
  - Valve stenosis/regurgitation  
  - Wall thickening  
  - Right ventricular dysfunction

  - Pulmonary artery pressure  
  - Valve severity levels  
  - Septal & wall thickness  
- **Target:** `shd_moderate_or_greater_flag` (0 = no SHD, 1 = SHD present)  

👉 The main focus is **binary classification**.  

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, standardize ECG variables  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Study feature distributions & correlations with SHD outcomes  
3. **Model Development:** Train and fine-tune multiple ML models  
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** ROC-AUC, F1-score, precision, recall  
5. **Explainability Layer:** Use SHAP/LIME for model interpretation  
6. **Recommendation System:**  
   - Convert model outputs into natural language explanations  
   - Provide suggestions for follow-up clinical evaluation or risk management
